CPS393 Lab 02A

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXAMPLES:

In the following questions, the examples assume you are working in directory
/usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/labs/lab03/testfiles 
A long listing of this directory is:

total 24
-rwxr-xr-- 1 dwoit cps393    0 Sep 21 20:23 a8*
-rw-r-xr-- 1 dwoit cps393    0 Sep 21 20:27 BIRD*

PROGRAM NAMES:

Make a separate shell program to answer each of the questions below. Your programs
should be named lab03Qx where x is the question number.  e.g., The shell program to 
answer question 4 below is named: lab03Q4

PROGRAM CONTENTS:

When you are directed to use a specific command, such as "ls", you may also use any
options required, e.g., "ls -l", or "ls -lt", etc.

Remember the first line of each shell program must be:
#!/bin/bash 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. List all entries (files and directories) in the current directory
   whose names contain ONLY upper-case letters. Directories must have a "/" appended.
   You must use ls piped to grep 

   Output should be: 
BIRD
DOG
DOGDIR/

2. Show a long listing for the second newest FILE (not directory) in the current directory.
   Your shell program must answer the question using the following line (with XXX changed 
   to whatever you need to answer the question).
   ls XXX | grep XXX | head XXX 
   HINT: The ls command should use an option that lists entries from newest to oldest
         The grep should select only files by looking for a "-" at the start of the line.

   Output should be:
-rw-r-xr-- 1 dwoit cps393    0 Sep 21 20:27 BIRD


3. Use find to list all files (not directories) in the current directory for which user 
   has x perms. Hint: use the -type and -perm options for find.
   Output should be:
   ./dir1/x
   ./a8
   ./dog11
   ./mouse
   ./out1


4. Your shell program displays the file /usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/labs/lab03/testfiles/out1
   except that: 
       -all occurrences of the string "dog" are changed to upper-case.
       -all occurrences of strings of digits (of any length) at the end of a line 
           are changed to a single X
    Your solution must use one or more sed commands.

    Output should be:
    -rwx------ 1 dwoit cps393    0 Jan 21 13:14 aX
    drwx------ 2 dwoit cps393 4096 Jan 21 14:31 dirX
    drwxrwx--- 2 dwoit cps393 4096 Jan 21 12:52 dirX
    -rw-rw---- 1 dwoit cps393    0 Jan 21 12:51 DOGX
    -rwx------ 1 dwoit cps393    0 Jan 21 12:51 DOGX
    -rw-rw---- 1 dwoit cps393    0 Jan 21 12:51 DOGX
    -rwxrw---- 1 dwoit cps393    0 Feb  3  2011 outX


5. Your shell program lists the userids of all the people who have logged into the current 
   machine on a particular day of the week. The day is supplied as a command-line argument 
   to your shell program.
   For example, if I ran your program as follows:  ./lab03Q5 Sun
   then your program would give a list of userids of those people who have ever logged
   into the machine on a Sunday. No userid should be listed more than once.
   Remember that the command-line argument is "$1" in your code. 

   I ran the program on a certain machine as follows:  ./lab03Q5 Sun
   and it produced a list of output such as:
    aabhari
    aferworn
    allam
    dwoit
    ktman
    mes
    vmisic

    HINTS: 
      -use last to list everyone who has ever logged into the machine
      -use grep to list only those logins that occurred on a certain day ($1)
      -use cut to keep only the userid (columns 1 to 8)
      -use sort to sort the userid list
      -use uniq to eliminate duplicates from the userid list
