CPS393 Lab05 

1. Write a shell program named lab05 that takes 2 or more command line arguments.
   If there are no "issues", then the program prints this message on standard output:
       file xx has fewest lines (f)
       file yy has most lines (m)

   where 
     xx and yy are 2 files from the command line arguments, and 
     f is the number of lines of file xx, and 
     m is the number of lines of file yy

   Possible "issues":
   -----------------
   -0 or 1 command line arguments are given.
    In this case, print the following on standard error, where "lab05" is the name of
    the program, and is NOT hardcoded:
    lab05: expecting 2 or more files 

   -no valid files are given on the command line arguments (e.g., files do not
    exist, or are not readable, or arguments were directories, not files, etc.)
    In this case, print the following on standard error, where "lab05" is the name of 
    the program, but is NOT hardcoded:
    lab05: no valid files

    -only one valid file is given on the command line (e.g., all-but one of the files 
    specified were valid files, or directories, etc.)
     In this case, print the 2 lines as in "no issues" above, but the same file is
     listed for both xx and yy.

    Exit codes:
    1 if something was printed on standard error
    0 otherwise


2. Submit lab05
